# 🚀 Production SMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up real SMS delivery for your OTP system using Twilio.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. A Twilio account (free trial available)
2. A credit card for phone number purchase
3. Access to your server's `.env` file

## 🔧 Step 1: Create Twilio Account

1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Sign up with your email and phone number
3. Verify your phone number
4. Complete the account setup

## 📱 Step 2: Get Twilio Credentials

1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** on the dashboard
3. Copy these values (you'll need them for the .env file)

## 🛒 Step 3: Purchase a Phone Number

1. In Twilio Console, go to **Phone Numbers** → **Manage** → **Buy a number**
2. Choose a phone number with **SMS capabilities**
3. Complete the purchase (costs ~$1/month)
4. Copy the purchased phone number

## ⚙️ Step 4: Update Environment Variables

Update your `server/.env` file with the following:

```env
# Twilio SMS Configuration (Production)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_actual_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_actual_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_actual_phone_number_here

# SMS Provider (change from 'console' to 'twilio' for production)
SMS_PROVIDER=twilio
```

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Configuration

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-twilio-sms.js
```

This will:
- Check your Twilio credentials
- Test the connection
- Send a test SMS to your phone
- Verify the setup is working

## 🚀 Step 6: Deploy to Production

1. **Update your production environment** with the same .env variables
2. **Restart your server** to load the new configuration
3. **Test the complete OTP flow** in your frontend
4. **Monitor usage** in the Twilio Console

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
